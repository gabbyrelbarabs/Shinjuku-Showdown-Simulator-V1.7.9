	<div id="contentBoss" class="content scrollable" style="display:none;">
      <strong>Boss Info:</strong>
      <p>The King of Curses himself, Ryomen Sukuna.</p>
	  <p> A violent, merciless force of nature, killing anyone in his way.</p>
	  <p>Age: 1000+ (Born from the Heian-Era)</p>
	  <p>Height: Unknown</p>
	  <p>Weight: Unknown</p>
	  <p>Abilities:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Close Combat:</strong> His main offense when in close combat with enemies.</li>
		<li><strong>Cleave:</strong> A unique attack he could land on targets, breaking defenses and dealing extra damage.</li>
		<li><strong>Dismantle:</strong> His main attack, a ranged-type attack that slashes foes from afar.</li>
		<li><strong>Slicerweb:</strong> A special attack he uses, smashing into the ground and slashing everything that stays on the ground(platforms included), stunning them.</li>
		<li><strong>Cleave Rush:</strong> A special attack he uses, charging at his target and obliterating them with a powerful cleave. But it stuns him as well from the recoil.</li>
		<li><strong>Reverse Cursed Technique:</strong> The boss may also use this unique technique, replenishing his technique and stamina, regenerating his HP by around 20-30% over the course of 5 seconds.</li>
      </ul>
	  <br>
	  <h5>------------------------------------------Phase 2------------------------------------------</h5>
	  <br>
      <p>However, Sukuna may get desperate, quickly using RCT while summoning some new foes: </p>
	  <li><strong>Eight-handled Sword Divergent Sila Divine General Mahoraga:</strong> A powerful entity summoned from his vessel, Megumi Fushiguro,'s Ten Shadows Technique. With a huge amount of durability, this guy will defend Sukuna with all his life. He also has a unique ability to <strong>adapt</strong>, getting even stronger and more durable over time, so make sure to eliminate him before he becomes invincible.</li>
	  <li><strong>Chimera Beast Agito:</strong> Another powerful entity created from several other creatures from the Ten Shadows technique. With her extremely fast speed and a powerful offense, but horrible defenses, she will stay in the high grounds, guarding the target from taking advantage of the high ground and stealing the mysterious objects. Make sure to neutralize her if you want your precious power-ups.</li>
	  <br>
	  <p>NOTE: Sukuna is at his toughest in this phase, so be careful, and find a way to exterminate him immediately.
	  <br>
	  <br>
	  <h5>------------------------------------------Phase 3------------------------------------------</h5>
	  <br>
	  <p>However, Sukuna may get desperate once more, as he may then finally use his most powerful technique...</p>
	  <p><strong>Domain Expansion: Malevolent Shrine</strong></p>
	  <li>When this ability activates, Sukuna will enter his original, most powerful form, replenishing all of his stamina and greatly increasing all of his stats, and powering up his abilities. Targets within the domain will also begin getting slashed and torn apart by a barrage of <strong>Cleaves</strong> and <strong>Dismantles</strong> as time goes on, so be careful.</li>
	  <br>
	  <p>When Sukuna enters his final form, he will also reawaken hidden techniques he's kept a secret from his time in the Heian-Era: </p>
	  <li><strong>Kamutoke: </strong> A powerful technique Sukuna can conjure up, striking the battlefield with lightning, shocking and stunning anything hit.</li>
	  <li><strong>Fugue(Open): </strong> Sukuna's most powerful technique. When fired, it will burn up the entire battlefield if it hits something, ensuring death to everything. So be careful if he begins to chant this.</li>
	  <p>And that's about all the information we have on the King of Curses. </p>
	  <br>
	  <p>Good luck on your battle, Satoru Gojo. </p>
	  <p>Exorcise him at all costs.</p>
